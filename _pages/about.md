I am a **B.Tech with MS by research** student at IIIT, Hyderabad. I work on robotic perception and 3D computer vision at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), supervised by Prof. [K. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) at RRC, and Prof. [Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) (Brown University).

My research interests lie at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics, focusing on developing rich 3D representations for robot manipulation. My previous works have explored multiple 3D representations for 3D scene understanding and shape completion, learning improved priors over implicit neural representations like NeRFs, and diffusion-based grasp generation, particularly for multi-arm scenarios. Looking forward, I am interested in building systems that can combine semantic scene understanding with physical interaction capabilities to enable robots to perform sophisticated bimanual tasks in unstructured environments.

**I am looking for Fall 2025 PhD opportunities!**
