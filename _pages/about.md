I am a final year **B.Tech with MS by research** student at IIIT, Hyderabad. I work on robotic perception and 3D computer vision at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), supervised by Prof. [K. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en) at RRC, and Prof. [Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) (Brown University).

My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision and robotics, where I focus on developing rich 3D representations for robot manipulation. My previous works have explored multiple 3D representations for 3D scene understanding and shape completion, learning improved priors over implicit neural representations like NeRFs, and diffusion-based grasp generation, particularly for multi-arm scenarios. Looking forward, I am interested in building **structured representations that can combine semantic cues with physical interaction capabilities** to enable robots to perform whole-body bimanual manipulation in open-world environments.

**I am looking for Fall 2025 PhD opportunities!**
